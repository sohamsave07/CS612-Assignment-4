    Not only did the majority of Cavs fans never burn their gear, they didn't throw it out or hand it off to Goodwill, either. 
    Last Friday night, they did. 23, with two-fifths of the rest wearing some other type of Cavs or LeBron-branded gear. 
    Beyond these criticisms, the staggering amount of attention paid to one athlete's free agency should be enough to make anyone squeamish.

    Naturally, our leaders would like us to believe otherwise, with County Executive Ed FitzGerald already having held a press conference to lay out 
    James' economic impact on the region -- somewhere near $50 million annually, by their hazy estimates. «I think there is a measurable economic value,»</p> 
    <p>FitzGerald said. «When people say this is just about an athlete making money, there's more to it than that. Other people will make a living.» 
    But even that's less than 0.5 percent in North East Ohio's $100 billion economy.
    LeBron's free agency leaves no choice but to grant that, for better or worse, sports represent the most accessible common narrative in America today. 
    «I feel my calling here goes above basketball,» James said. «I have a responsibility to lead, in more ways than one, and I take that very seriously. 
    My presence can make a difference in Miami, but I think it can mean more where I'm from».
    It's the opposite of Charles Barkley's «I'm not a role model,» and it communicates aspirations well beyond anything Michael Jordan accomplished 
    on his run as the world's best basketball player and shoe salesman.</p>
    <p>If America needs anything, it's a leveling, and nobody has ever really become 
    a global icon for doing anything else. Maybe you went to high school with him, or know someone who dated him or played against him as a prep. 
    Maybe you were at the same party or shopping mall once, or served him an Appletini, or fixed his car.
    Or maybe you're one of the thousands of inner city kids whose lives he's touched through his philanthropy. The hysteria over this free agency – 
    one that froze not just the NBA but the entire sports media complex for a full week in anticipation of his decision -- was a powerful reminder that 
    the Association is a players' league. «I didn't mean most of the things I said in there. The venom it produced, from all sides ... I wish ... 
    I wish I had never done it».</p>
    <p>ESPN was another multi-billion dollar entity feeling sorry last week because of LeBron. The choice to break the news of the decision through 
    Sports Illustrated is seen as a reflection of James' displeasure with the way ESPN handled the disastrous broadcast of the first «Decision» in 2010. 
    The sight of the World Wide Leader's top NBA reporters stunned, blankly reading and then «confirming» printouts of the SI statement on air, will go
    down in media circus history. As for altering balances of power outside of the sports world, it's surely only a matter of LeBron's will, not ability.
    Imagine, for example, how easily an LBJ Election Day bus tour could neutralize the Ohio Republican Party's Herculean efforts to suppress 
    the minority vote.
