    As if the life and times of Sachin Tendulkar weren’t prominent enough, the little master now has his own film, directed by James Erskine, 
    out in cinemas now. The Cricket Blog was lucky enough to get invited along to an advance screening of the film.
    I must admit that I was expecting the film to be comprised of near total sycophantic guff, although Erskine’s stellar work on Pantani: 
    The Accicdental Death of a Cyclist filled me with optimism. It’s hard to quantify what Tendulkar means to India. 
    This film carefully builds the profile of an icon and whilst yes, is sycophantic in part , is worth the time investment of cricket fans everywhere.</p>
    <p>It is, for the most part, narrated by Tendulkar himself with behind the scenes footage from of the more intimate moments of his life. 
    His Test debut against Pakistan when he stepped into the lions’ den of international cricket in the fiercest rivalry of them all, 
    where he had his nose broken but understood the power of his actions even as a child; he really did look like a boy amongst men in that series.
    His promotion and swift demotion from the captaincy and the impact this had on him – the spectre of Mohammad Azharuddin looming large over 
    the young skipper. It was clearly the lowest ebb of Tendulkar’s career as he faced questions over his future, a creaking body and threats from 
    members of the public.
    The one thing that is clearly presented throughout is the impact Tendulkar had on his own family.</p>
    <p>Armed guards were present in 
    their household after the 2007 World Cup and his family lived every low point with him and suffered nervously through the highs. 
    His wife plays an instrumental role in the Tendulkar story and you can see Tendulkar’s pining for his son to be a successful cricketer shining through, 
    too.
    The other major familial theme of the Tendulkar story is his father. Tendulkar speaks of his calm and his control, two things 
    Tendulkar brought to his cricket. His father’s passing was, like it is for most, a major juncture in his life. 
    Everything that needed to be said about Tendulkar had already been said. Whilst it was clearly an obsession of Tendulkar’s, it doesn’t fit in as something that needed to happen. It was too perfect to appear believable in a film, but this isn’t a work of fiction.</p>
    <p>Perhaps, however, this was the moment at which he should have retired.
    It would have made a fitting finale and the film glosses over the two year struggle to reach that 100th international century, 
    paying it lip service en route to the conclusion. A scrappy century achieved against Bangladesh in an Asia Cup game wasn’t the grand stage perhaps 
    Tendulkar envisaged. That moment had passed.
    Still, the film lays bare a man the likes of whom we will probably never see again. Upon leaving the cinema, my fellow blogger 
    Andy Hunter remarked that he truly is a one off.
